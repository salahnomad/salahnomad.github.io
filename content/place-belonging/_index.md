# Place & Belonging
## Carrying Your Home Like a Compass

My first lesson in geography was realizing I was a foreigner in my own neighborhood. My life was a mosaic crafted from two tiles‚Äîthe Jbala mountains of my family and the French-influenced city outside our door. This section is my lifelong attempt to map the untranslatable landscape that lives inside all of us who exist between worlds.

The articles here are a guide to the true nomadic journey: learning to carry your inner landscape like a snail carries its shell. We trade a tourist's gaze for an artisan's hands, and we discover that our deepest roots are the only keys we need to unlock a sense of belonging, wherever we are.
