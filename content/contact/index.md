### A Note on Correspondence

To honor our mutual time and energy, please consider the following before sending your message:

-   **Dialogue over Transaction:** Every response is crafted personally. I value meaningful conversations that build bridges.
-   **Clarity as a Compass:** The clearer your query, the more thoughtful my response can be.
-   **Patience of the Artisan:** Like a good tagine, a considered reply takes time to prepare. I read every genuine message and will respond as soon as I am able.

This harbor is a place for connection. If your message is sent with intention and respect, it will be received in the same spirit.
