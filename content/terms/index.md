*Where Digital Paths Meet Mediterranean Shores*

---

### **1. Introduction: Joining the Caravan**
> *“True freedom means knowing which roots to nurture.”*

By accessing salahnomad.com (“the Site”), you agree to these Terms, woven with the same care as a zellige mosaic. Operated by Salah Nomad (“we,” “us”), the Site is for those who navigate borders and algorithms alike. If these Terms clash with your compass, refrain from use.

---

### **2. Intellectual Roots: Honoring Creative Legacy**
> *“Olive trees outlive empires; so do ideas.”*

All content—text, images, ebooks, and philosophies like *Rooted Nomadism*—is our protected intellectual harvest. Use it personally, never commercially. Reproduction without written consent? Like uprooting centuries-old groves.

---

### **3. Traveler’s Code: Respectful Passage**
> *“Borders are illusions, but respect is real.”*

- **Navigate lawfully**: No spamming, hacking, or digital piracy.
- **Be authentic**: Impersonation erodes trust like cracked clay.
Violations may exile you from the caravan.

---

### **4. Affiliate Links: Transparent Currents**
> *“Sardines nourish both shores; so do honest links.”*

Some links earn commissions if you purchase—think of them as Phoenician trade routes. We only recommend vessels we’d sail ourselves. *(Disclosure: As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases, and may participate in other affiliate programs.)*

---

### **5. Desert Wisdom: No Guarantees**
> *“Even olive groves face storms.”*

- **Not advice**: Our content guides, but consult experts for your journey.
- **Ever-changing dunes**: We strive for accuracy but can’t command the winds.
Use the Site at your own risk.

---

### **6. Storm-Proof Responsibilities: Understanding Our Limits**
> *“Cork oaks bend; we too have boundaries.”*

We’re not liable for damages from Site use, as per applicable laws.

---

### **7. Third-Party Oases: External Paths**
Linked sites? Like distant markets—explore, but we don’t govern their wares.

---

### **8. Privacy Compass: Data’s Journey**
Your data travels respectfully, per our [Privacy Policy](/privacy/).

---

### **9. Governing Winds: Legal Horizons**
These Terms follow laws of Spain. <!-- Ou la juridiction appropriée -->

---

### **10. Shifting Sands: Terms Evolve**
We may update Terms. Continued use means you embrace new trails. Check the "Last Updated" date.

---

### **11. Campfire Conversations: Contact Us**
