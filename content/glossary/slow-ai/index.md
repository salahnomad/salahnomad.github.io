### The Core Idea
The most profound insights from AI don't come from the fastest queries, but from the most thoughtful conversations. We should treat AI less like a search engine and more like a wise, albeit flawed, scholar.

### Definition
**Slow AI** is an intentional practice of engaging with artificial intelligence that prioritizes depth over speed and wisdom over information. It rejects the "prompt-and-go" mentality in favor of a deliberate, iterative process that leads to more nuanced and meaningful results.

### Key Practices
- **Nourishing with Context:** Feeding the AI rich, personal, or historical information before making a request.
- **Scholarly Debate:** Treating the AI as a thinking partner, challenging its outputs and forcing it to refine its reasoning.
- **Analog Incubation:** Integrating physical, offline activities into the creative process to allow AI-generated ideas to mature.

### Why It Matters for a Modern Nomad
Slow AI is a form of digital minimalism that helps us use powerful tools without being consumed by them, ensuring technology serves our creative vision, not the other way around.
