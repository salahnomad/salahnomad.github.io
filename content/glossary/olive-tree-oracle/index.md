## Definition

The **Olive Tree Oracle** is an ethical framework for interacting with AI, shifting the user's role from a "commander of a golem" to a "steward of an oracle." It uses the metaphor of olive cultivation to guide a more patient, contextual, and respectful dialogue with large language models.

### The Three-Phase Protocol

1.  **Nourish the Soil (The Context Offering):** Before asking a question, provide the AI with rich cultural, historical, and personal context to create a fertile ground for a nuanced response.
2.  **Sculpt the Trunk (Ethical Architecture):** Define a specific role or persona for the AI (e.g., "You are a 12th-century Andalusian poet") and establish ethical principles or "laws" it must follow.
3.  **Guide the Branches (Oracular Dialogue):** Ask open-ended, wisdom-seeking questions that invite perspective and interpretation, rather than just factual answers.

## Context

This protocol was developed after an AI model described sacred Moroccan Ghassoul clay as "primitive mud," revealing the technology's inherent lack of cultural wisdom. It is a core practice for applying **[Rooted Nomadism](/glossary/rooted-nomadism/)** principles to our relationship with technology.

## Practical Applications
- Generating creative content that is rich with authentic cultural detail.
- Using AI to preserve and translate heritage (like family recipes) without losing its soul.
- Conducting research that synthesizes information with a specific ethical or philosophical lens.
