Google's E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) isn't a new technical challenge; it's a machine's clumsy attempt to measure ancient human trust. The **Souk Algorithm** is a business philosophy that masters E-E-A-T by focusing on people, not platforms.

### The Core Idea
Instead of optimizing for Google, optimize for the wisdom of a 1,000-year-old marketplace. Trust and authority will follow naturally.

### The Four Laws of Timeless SEO
1.  **The Generational Stall (Experience):** Build your "About" page as a testament to your lived journey, not a list of credentials.
2.  **The Open Sack (Authoritativeness):** Share your best knowledge freely and generously, signaling confidence and mastery.
3.  **The Mint Tea Backlink (Trustworthiness):** Forge genuine relationships before ever asking for a link or a transaction.
4.  **The Tagine Question (Expertise):** Go beyond the user's explicit query to solve their deeper, unstated emotional needs.

### Why It Matters in 2025
In the age of generative AI, content that is deeply human, story-driven, and built on genuine relationships is the ultimate competitive advantage. This is the playbook for it.
