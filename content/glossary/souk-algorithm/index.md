### The Core Idea
The secret to winning in the age of AI-driven search isn't to optimize for machines, but to **double down on being human**. Google's E-E-A-T is just a clumsy attempt to codify what a good merchant has known for centuries.

### Definition
The **Souk Algorithm** is a business philosophy that models digital strategy on the four unwritten laws of trust that govern traditional marketplaces. It provides a human-centric framework for building genuine authority and a loyal audience.

### The Four Laws
1.  **The Generational Stall (Demonstrate Lived Experience):** Your "About" page and personal story are your most powerful assets.
2.  **The Open Sack (Share Knowledge Generously):** Give away your best ideas to prove your expertise and build authority.
3.  **The Mint Tea Backlink (Build Real Relationships):** Forge genuine connections before you ever ask for anything in return.
4.  **The Tagine Question (Solve the Deeper Need):** Understand and address the user's emotional problem, not just their search query.

### Why It Matters for a Modern Nomad
This is your compass for building a sustainable online presence. It shifts your focus from short-term tactics to building a long-term reputation that travels with you.
