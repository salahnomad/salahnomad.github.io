# **Rooted Nomadism**

## **Mediterranean Wisdom for Modern Lives**

Every week, I send a dispatch from the space between shores.

Not news. Not trends. Just **thoughtful reflection** on:
- **Resilience** — how ancient practices solve modern chaos
- **Creativity** — constraint-based frameworks from Mediterranean craft
- **Intentional technology** — slow-tech philosophy for digital overwhelm
- **Geography of belonging** — what roots mean when you move

## **Why 'Rooted Nomadism'?**

I was born in Morocco. I live in Spain. I work globally.

For years, I thought I had to choose: **roots or wings**. Then I realized the olive tree has both — deep roots, wide branches, the ability to endure drought and still produce.

**Rooted Nomadism** is that philosophy:
- **Deep roots** — inner world, values, practices that travel with you
- **Wide branches** — engagement with places, people, ideas
- **Resilience** — thriving through change, not despite it

This newsletter explores that balance.
