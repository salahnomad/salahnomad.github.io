*Where Data Flows Like the Loukkos River*

---

### **1. Introduction: Guardians of Your Digital Footprints**
> *“Data, like fish, should enrich ecosystems.”*

We protect your privacy as fiercely as olive groves guard their roots. This Policy explains how we collect, use, and shelter your data under GDPR and CCPA/CPRA.

---

### **2. Data Harvest: What We Gather**
> *“Every journey leaves traces.”*

- **Shared freely**: Name, email (via comments [powered by Giscus, see their policy], forms, newsletters).
- **Gathered silently**: IP address, device details (via server logs and potentially analytics cookies).
- **Affiliate trails**: Click tracking for honest commissions.

---

### **3. Olive Press: How We Use Your Data**
> *“Pressed with purpose, not waste.”*

- Respond to your queries (like a medina guide).
- Send newsletters (with your explicit consent via signup).
- Strengthen the Site’s roots through aggregated, anonymized analytics (if implemented).

**GDPR Grounds**: Consent, necessity (responding to you), or legitimate interest (site function/security).

---

### **4. Cookie Jar: Digital Sustenance**
> *“Even nomads store provisions.”*

- **Essential cookies**: May be used for basic site function (e.g., theme preference via localStorage). Giscus uses cookies/localStorage.
- **Analytics crumbs**: We currently *do not* use invasive analytics like Google Analytics. <!-- Modifie si tu en utilises -->
- **Affiliate cookies**: Placed by third-party networks when you click an affiliate link.
Manage standard cookies via browser settings. See affiliate network policies for their tracking details.

### **5. Caravan Shares: Third-Party Travels**
Data may journey to:
- **Giscus:** For comments (hosted on GitHub Discussions).
- **Email Provider:** If you subscribe to a newsletter (e.g., Mailchimp, ConvertKit).
- **Affiliate Networks:** When you click affiliate links.
Your data is **never sold**.

---

### **6. Data Seasons: Retention Rhythms**
- **Comments**: Managed by Giscus/GitHub according to their terms.
- **Newsletters**: Until you unsubscribe.

---

### **7. Fortified Wells: Protecting Your Streams**
We use HTTPS (SSL encryption). Giscus and potential newsletter providers have their own security.

---

### **8. Your Compass Rights**
> *“Roots anchor, but you steer.”*

- **EU travelers (GDPR)**: Access, correct, delete your data where applicable (e.g., newsletter list). Request restriction or portability. Object. Withdraw consent.
- **California voyagers (CCPA/CPRA)**: Know, delete, opt-out (we don't "sell/share" under the typical definition). Non-discrimination.
To exercise rights related to data we directly control (like a potential newsletter list), please use our secure [Contact Page](/contact/). For comment data, refer to Giscus/GitHub.

### **9. Young Saplings: Children’s Privacy**

### **10. Distant Shores: External Links**
